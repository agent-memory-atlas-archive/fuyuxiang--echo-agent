!!! warning "code-runner is not a security sandbox"

## research

Information retrieval and deep research skills.

| Skill | Description | Required Env Vars |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| arxiv | Search arXiv papers, get abstracts and PDF links | — |

| web-search | Search with DuckDuckGo or a self-hosted SearXNG instance | No API key; relevant service or dependency required |

!!! warning "deep-research costs markedly more than the other skills"
    It runs several rounds of search and page fetching, so a single invocation can consume tens of times the tokens of an ordinary exchange. The skill itself neither estimates usage nor imposes a cap.

    Constrain it from the cost side instead: `cost.dailyBudgetUsd` sets a hard daily ceiling (reaching it refuses further calls) and `cost.softThresholdRatio` warns at a fraction of it. After the fact, `echo-agent cost` breaks spending down by model. See [cost control](../../guides/cost-control.en.md).

## utility

General-purpose tool skills.

| Skill | Description | Required Env Vars |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| calculator | Math calculations, unit conversions, and formula solving | — |

| maps-poi | Query places and routes with OpenStreetMap/Nominatim and OSRM | No key by default; optional `AMAP_API_KEY` |
| text-tools | Text processing toolkit: translation, formatting, regex replace, encoding | — |

## Credentials and runtime requirements

The table distinguishes required account credentials from optional provider keys. `image-gen` uses `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `STABILITY_API_KEY` for those respective paths; Pollinations needs no key. `tts-voice` needs no key for Edge TTS and uses `OPENAI_API_KEY` for its OpenAI path. `notion-sync` uses `NOTION_API_TOKEN`; `github-ops` requires an authenticated `gh` CLI. CalDAV calendar access needs account credentials, while local ICS needs no network key. See each skill's `SKILL.md` for installation commands and limits.
