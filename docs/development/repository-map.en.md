## Key relationships

`echo_agent/app.py` wires configuration, storage, models, the agent, channels, and the Gateway. `echo_agent/tools/` is the public tool extension interface; `echo_agent/agent/tools/` implements built-in tools. The Gateway uses `aiohttp` and token/pairing authorization, not a JWT server or an ASGI framework. SQLite schema migrations run when `echo_agent/storage/sqlite.py` initializes a connection; `echo-agent migrate` in `echo_agent/cli/migrate_cmd.py` handles memory data.
